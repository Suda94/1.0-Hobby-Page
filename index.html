            <p>
                Bouldering is among the newest forms of climbing, and these days it may be the most popular.<br>

                I was introduced to the Bouldering through a friends link, which I have been hooked since then, as it
                requires you to be coordinated while being efficient climber and the thrill of adrenaline rush while
                completing challenges.<br>

                It does not require tall walls or complicated knots, and it is fun in groups. Especially in cities,
                Bouldering is the most common form of indoor climbing. It is a great way to train, learn, or
                just have a good
                time.

                BOULDERING IS FOR EVERYONE! Bouldering is a style of climbing done close to the ground without the use
                of ropes and
                harnesses, and with crash matting for protection. This popular branch of rock climbing practices
                climbing moves
                and problem solving skills to move up the wall.<br>

                Bouldering is an Olympic Sport! All three disciplines of rock climbing will feature at the 2020
                Olympics: Bouldering, Lead Climbing and Speed Climbing.<br>

                fantastic

            <p>
                The best way to start bouldering is simply to book an introduction at a local bouldering or climbing
                gym. There you’ll be shown the basics of how to boulder safely, given an overview of the gym and its
                features, with a little basic technique to get you started.

                From there you can come back and climb whenever you’d like. Bouldering is a great way of getting
                regular
                exercise while also doing a bit of socializing. You can work up a sweat but be mentally engaged,
                enjoy
                the challenge, plus have a chat with others whilst you’re at it.
